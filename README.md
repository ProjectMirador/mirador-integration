## Integrating Mirador

This repository is designed to show integrating Mirador 3 with modern frontend build systems.


### Build with webpack

See `./webpack` for a basic webpack setup for Mirador 3 + a plugin.

```sh
npm run webpack
```

### Run with parcel

See `./parcel`, but essentially it is just an html file referencing the JavaScript.

```sh
npm run parcel
```
